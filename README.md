### Item Level Completion

It is easy in REDCap to mark an instrument as complete. Simply change the status of the instrument in its drop-down menu. This makes completeness status produced by REDCap a subjective measure. The rationale for this is that some data cannot be recovered, because the participant is no longer available to improve the data. In these cases the instrument is 'declared' complete.

This procedures breaks down in a distributed large study as it becomes more difficult to enforce centrally the subjective rules that define this type of completeness. This project is an attempt to provide an objective way to measure item level completion that is aware of branching logic rules. It provides a web-interface to review data and it is used in the ABCD project to assess data collection sites for the reached level of completion.
