# Masking computation lists for each participant fields that are hidden

An item can belong to one of these categories: missing - should have a value, missing - hidden by branching logic, present - should have a value given branching logic, present - should not have value given branching logic.

This module requires substantial amounts of main memory if used on a large project (>16GB for 10,000 measures and 4,000 participants).
